This repository contains datasets and code related to a project on diagnosing ADHD using artificial intelligence (AI). 
The goal of this research is to explore how AI can enhance the speed and accuracy of ADHD diagnosis through machine learning models and convolutional neural networks (CNN) using clinical data and anatomical MRI scans.
The project involves two primary approaches:
1. Clinical Data Analysis: Utilizing machine learning models like Random Forest and Logistic Regression to analyze the correlation of ADHD with various clinical metrics, including stress, anxiety, and depression scales.
2. MRI Image Classification: Using CNNs and dimensionality reduction techniques to diagnose ADHD from MRI scans.
